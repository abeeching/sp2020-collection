## What is this?
This is an assignment that came in two parts, it seems:
1. The first was to create classes for a lion and a pine tree. Each class would have its own attributes, which we would then have to print out individually for each instance of the class and modify. The attributes were numeric, so we didn't have to do much there.
2. The second part was to create a class for a snake, which took different data types as attributes. We then had to create methods that would print out strings contianing the various attributes. A little more complicated than the first part.

I find it interesting that we were told to use get and set methods, particularly for part one, despite us not having learned access modifiers yet. It's a good habit to get into, though.
