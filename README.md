# sp2020-collection
[SPRING 2020] - Don't seem to have any significant projects posted from this semester here. So, to make up for this, I'm going to post various bits of work from that semester into this repo. I imagine the assignments are different nowadays, but let me know if I need to pull these down!

## Preface:
This is really the only semester I can think of where I didn't have any *significant* projects, but this is the semester in which I learned C++ and object-oriented programming as a whole, so I figured I should at least put *something* up. So here we are!

(NOTE: This is literally just a collection of assignment code. I'm pretty sure assignments for the course in question are different now, but if you're a professor with the university seeing this repo and you need me to take things down so you can use/reuse these assignments, please contact me via my university email and I will be happy to oblige.)

## Introduction:
This is a compilation of C++ assignments and labs I did in the Spring 2020 semester. Not every assignment I've done will go up here, but some of them will; my focus will probably be on assignments that showcase the OOP concepts I was learning at the time, since a good chunk of the semester was devoted to procedural programming review if I recall.

## How to Use:
These are not meant to be *used*. This is just a showcase of stuff I did during this semester. Descriptions of work posted to this repo will be provded below as I add them.

## Reflections:
I hardly used C++ after it was introduced to me in this course. Nothing against the language or anything, but I struggled so much trying to learn advanced concepts with Java in the next programming course that I ended up sticking to it. It was the language I was most familiar with after having spent many evenings essentially learning by brute-force. (On that note, Python's the language I'd say I'm second-most familiar with, since I had to use it pretty extensively towards the end of my time at the university. It was a lot easier to digest!)

2020 is the year that things got... weird. About half of my time in this semester was spent trying to learn and complete work remotely, and I've noticed that assignments going towards the end of the semester became shorter in general because of it. I don't remember if we were supposed to do any major projects in the course or not, but I imagine we were supposed to do more lab-based assignments (or at least slightly more substantial ones?).

Despite everything, the work I did this semester was significant in the sense that I learned important concepts regarding OOP that I would use extensively in later courses and projects. This collection is the best way I can think of to demonstrate what I was learning at the time.
